## Android Search It
Often times, us developers find ourselves in a position where we see a term in our codebase and want to quickly look it up on `Google` or `Stackoverflow`. This plugin saves you the trouble of copy pasting, just select the desired text and hit the shortcut keys for the plugin and it will launch `Google` or `Stackoverflow` (based on your preference) on a browser with a predefined query for your selected text. 

I personally have found it quite handy, hope you do too. :)

### Want to fork it?
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/tusharkokane91/AndroidSearchIt.git`.
- Open it with `Intellij IDEA`.
- Build project, it should automatically detect it as a plugin project and set run configuration for the same.

### Plugin Usage Guidelines
